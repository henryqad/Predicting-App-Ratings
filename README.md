# Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree capstone project

This project focuses on the Google Play Store dataset, aiming to
understand and predict app ratings based on various features. The findings can be valuable to app developers and stakeholders seeking to understand factors that contribute to positive user ratings and app success.

Key steps include:
1. **Data Preparation**: Cleaning the dataset by handling missing values, converting data types, and removing duplicates.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Investigating app categories, ratings, pricing, and other features to understand their distributions and relationships.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Transforming existing features and creating new ones to enhance the predictive power of models.
4. **Machine Learning:** Training Linear Regression and Random Forest models to predict app ratings based on selected features.
5. **Insights:** Identifying important factors that influence app ratings and drawing conclusions based on the analysis.

# Questions:
1. What are the most common app categories in the Google Play Store?
2. What is the distribution of app ratings?
3. Which features are most important in predicting app ratings?
4. What are the top 10 app genres in the Google Play Store?
